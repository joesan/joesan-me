Recently I have been exploring more around the Kubernetes tooling, especially the ones that can do some pre-validation on the schema and the state of my Kubernetes deployment resources or more precisely the YAML files.
I came across a few of them like conftest, kubeval etc and a wrapper around such set of tools like the kube-tools project which can be used as a GitHub Actions in your GitHub project.</description></item><item><title>GitOps with K8s</title><link>https://bigelectrons.com/post/infra/k8s-git-ops-1/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bigelectrons.com/post/infra/k8s-git-ops-1/</guid><description>
