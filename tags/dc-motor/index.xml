DC Motor Speed Control with ROS We saw from the previous tutorial on how to measure the RPM of a DC Motor fitted with an encoder. In this tutorial, let us see how we could do a basic speed control using commands from a ROS node. Combined with what we learnt on how to use PID speed control algorithm let us put this all into practice. But first we need to create the circuit.</description></item><item><title>DC Motor with Encoder</title><link>https://bigelectrons.com/post/navo/dcmotor/dc-motor-with-encoder/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bigelectrons.com/post/navo/dcmotor/dc-motor-with-encoder/</guid><description>
DC Motor A DC Motor equipped with a built-in encoder is going to immensely help us in precisely controlling the speed at which the motor rotates. Let us go through the basics behind such an encoder and how it relates to the speed ot the motor.
In this tutorial, we will look at how to do speed control using a DC Motor that has a quadrature shaft encoder. I will be using this DC Motor with Encoder as a reference.</description></item></channel></rss>
