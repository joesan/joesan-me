Disclaimer: I'm not paid to write about this post, this is purely my ownership experience using these boots!
A blog on a pair of shoes? A bit unusual for my blog that I'm writing about a pair of shoes. It is still just a shoe, but it is a Red Wing Chukka, the 3140 in the Oro-Iginal leather. There is a reason why I'm writing about this piece of hardware that brings joy and comfort to my knee and foot.</description></item></channel></rss>
