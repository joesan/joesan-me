I have been wondering on how the math behind a Linear regression works as in most of the ML books that you encounter, the focus will be on giving you a linear equation and just plugging this equation in a Python library to solve for the slope and bias and then use it to predict the new values. It is very rare that they show you how to find the m and b values.</description></item><item><title>Liner Interpolation</title><link>https://bigelectrons.com/post/math/liner-interpolation/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bigelectrons.com/post/math/liner-interpolation/</guid><description>
In mathematics, linear interpolation is understood as a method of curve fitting using linear polynomials. A polynomial is just an expression that consists of variables along with their co-efficients. An example of a polynomial would be:
1x+2y&amp;amp;sup2 In the above equation, the variable x has 1 as its coefficient, the variable y has 2 as its coefficient. Let us assume that we have a set of linear data points pointing to the x and y-axis:</description></item><item><title>Posts</title><link>https://bigelectrons.com/post/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bigelectrons.com/post/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
