I had a necessity to generate a PDF document out of a set of jpg images that I had on my local hard drive on my Ubuntu 20.04 Laptop. I came across this simple step on how to do it. Here it is documented:
Install img2pdf 1sudo apt-get install -y img2pdf Navigate to the folder that contains your images and run the following command 1img2pdf *.jp* --output your-pdf.pdf As usual, img2pdf --help is your friend for additional options on how to use this package.</description></item><item><title>Moved from Apple to Infinitybook a.k.a Tuxedo a.k.a Ubuntu</title><link>https://bigelectrons.com/post/linux/ubutnu-tuxedo-1/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bigelectrons.com/post/linux/ubutnu-tuxedo-1/</guid><description>
I have been using a Mac for over 7 years now, I have used about 3 Mac's where the 3rd one is still working fine. I have kids at home, they feed food to it and because of that the keys on my Mac is out of order. So it was time for me to have some privacy and get one machine for myself.
Looking around the latest iteration of the MacBook Pro 13&amp;quot;, the configuration that I could get for the money and more importantly what I will be doing with it actually got me into thinking if I ever need a Mac at all?</description></item></channel></rss>
