What happened? It was time to move again! In one of my earlier posts, I have mentioned my move from Blogger to GH-Pages and for that I decided to go with Zola. It was all fine, but after a few months, I wanted to have few additional features for the theme that I was using. It was such a great and a simple theme and looked so elegant, but some features that I was in dire need of was kind of missing.</description></item></channel></rss>
