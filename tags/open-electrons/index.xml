open-electrons is an attempt by myself to abstract all e-mobility related protocols, use cases and much more.

With the open-electrons project, my aim is to provide a software stack which can be customized and deployed to mimic the functionality of an eMSP (eMobility Service Provider).
For more information, have a look here for some basic documentation and here for the source code.</description></item></channel></rss>
