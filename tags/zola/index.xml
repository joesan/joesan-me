What happened? It was time to move again! In one of my earlier posts, I have mentioned my move from Blogger to GH-Pages and for that I decided to go with Zola. It was all fine, but after a few months, I wanted to have few additional features for the theme that I was using. It was such a great and a simple theme and looked so elegant, but some features that I was in dire need of was kind of missing.</description></item><item><title>Moved from Blogger to GH Pages</title><link>https://bigelectrons.com/post/misc/blogger-to-gh-pages/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bigelectrons.com/post/misc/blogger-to-gh-pages/</guid><description>
I have been documenting so far with Blogger. Recently I started to do some Robotics projects with ROS. As I was doing it, I was looking for ways to get all what I do be documented. I know Github offers GH Pages, but I was a bit reluctant to try it out. So for the Navo project, I decided that GH Pages will be the source for my documentation, hence I wanted to give it a try.</description></item></channel></rss>
