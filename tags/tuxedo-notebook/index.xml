I have been using a Mac for over 7 years now, I have used about 3 Mac's where the 3rd one is still working fine. I have kids at home, they feed food to it and because of that the keys on my Mac is out of order. So it was time for me to have some privacy and get one machine for myself.
Looking around the latest iteration of the MacBook Pro 13&amp;quot;, the configuration that I could get for the money and more importantly what I will be doing with it actually got me into thinking if I ever need a Mac at all?</description></item></channel></rss>
