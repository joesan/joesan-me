I have been reading through the architectures of Neural Networks and wanted to grasp the idea behind calculating the weights in a Neural Network and as you can see in the image below is a simple 2 node 2 layer Neural Network.
As you can see that for simplicity’s sake, I have just used a 2 node 2 layer network, but the same holds true for any sized Neural Network. It's just that the size of the Matrix increases proportionally to the number of inputs!</description></item></channel></rss>
