Climbing the Pentatonic scales Recently, I can say that I made very good progress playing across the neck of my guitar. I memorized few pentatonic shapes, but I was stuck the whole while on those specific boxes. The whole thing did not make any sense to me. Just wandering within those boxes is not pleasant music. Frustrated, I looked at Youtube for some motivational ideas on how to unstuck me from the boxes.</description></item><item><title>On Navigating the Pentatonic scale</title><link>https://bigelectrons.com/post/misc/guitar-learning-2/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bigelectrons.com/post/misc/guitar-learning-2/</guid><description>

I remember my interest to play the guitar started in the year 2012 and without any hesitation, I went and purchased my first ever electric guitar, the Ibanez GSA 60 and a small Marshall amplifier. I'm not sure at that point in time if it was the right decision to start with an electric guitar but as I recollect, I don't think I made any significant progress with it. I was even struggling to play the basic chord shapes.</description></item></channel></rss>
