Basically a distributed system is one in which the components or processes or nodes that comprise a system is distributed across nodes or sometimes even across geographies. But these systems need to communicate with each other to accomplish something meaningful. The most efficient, scalable and proven way of making these distributed systems communicate is via passing messages, sometimes even having a messaging middleware (like Kafka for example.,) as a central component.</description></item></channel></rss>
