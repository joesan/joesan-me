Key Components in the Updated Architecture

External LLM System (top right)

Located outside the main MCP architecture flow
Contains the LLM inference engine
Includes its own vector database for embeddings
Provides API gateway for service integration


LLM Integration Component

Acts as a connector between the MCP core and the external LLM
Manages API calls, authentication, and data transformation
Translates between MCP-specific data structures and LLM inputs/outputs


Core MCP Components

MCP Server cluster with redundant nodes
Configuration database for application metadata
Message queue for asynchronous processing
Traditional layered architecture for security, registration, and control



Integration Points
In this architecture:

The LLM system remains independent, allowing it to be maintained, upgraded, or replaced without disrupting the MCP core
The integration component provides loose coupling between systems
The MCP can leverage LLM capabilities while maintaining control over when and how the AI is utilized

Advantages of External LLM Design
This approach offers several benefits:

Clearer separation of concerns between core MCP functions and AI capabilities
Better security isolation (AI system can have different access patterns)
Ability to utilize managed LLM services from cloud providers
Greater flexibility to switch or upgrade LLM models independently
