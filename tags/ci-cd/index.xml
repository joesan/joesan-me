I have been a happy user of the Travis CI free usage over the last couple of years. But one announcement recently made me deeply worried. Have a look here at their announcement
Yes, Travis CI will no longer be free for OSS projects. There is no point in blaming Travis CI for this but rather on those idiots who abused the free usage with crypto minites and tor nodes. These bastards completely broke the trust Travis CI free tier gave for OSS projects.</description></item></channel></rss>
