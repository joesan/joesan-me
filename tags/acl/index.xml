I could not say this more than what the title says. I had a very severe blow to my already damaged left knee. First a bit of history here and here.
It was on the 28th of September where I went for my first ever defensive sport training called &amp;quot;VingTsun&amp;quot;. Inspired by my Physio friend who is a beginner, I decided to give this training a try. I indeed watched few videos of it before committing myself to joining him for the training session which starts around 20:00 Hours near to where I live.</description></item><item><title>Oh my left knee - You cause my problems!</title><link>bigelectrons.com/post/misc/acl-knee-injury-5/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>bigelectrons.com/post/misc/acl-knee-injury-5/</guid><description>
This morning it was just a normal day as always. We always have some balloons in our hall as my younger daughter likes to play it like a volleyball with me. I also enjoy entertaining her for some time.
So there were a few balloons in the hall, I casually like to kick it. As I kicked one off my right leg, my left leg kind of went out of balance, it twisted (as I have no cross ligaments because of my MTB accident 2 years ago).</description></item><item><title>Yet another impact on the injured knee!</title><link>bigelectrons.com/post/misc/acl-knee-injury-4/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>bigelectrons.com/post/misc/acl-knee-injury-4/</guid><description>
Last Thursday, I took a day off. As the weather was good I decided to take my kids and my mom to Apeldoorn in the Netherlands. We wanted to visit the theme park and spend the day there. My mom is here with us in Germany to visit us and to take care of the kids during their summer vacation. Apeldoorn is a 2-hour drive from where we live. As usual, we did not manage to start early and ended up reaching our destination around 12:00.</description></item><item><title>4 Months update of my Knee</title><link>bigelectrons.com/post/misc/acl-knee-injury-3/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>bigelectrons.com/post/misc/acl-knee-injury-3/</guid><description>
It is now roughly 4 months since I injured my knee and the recovery so far has been very positive. On the downside, I have the feeling that my knee is not like it was before! Occasionally I get a strange wobbly feeling on my injured knee!
So for the first 2 months, I was not able to fully stretch or bend my injured leg, but that got a lot better now.</description></item><item><title>6 Weeks Update of my Knee</title><link>bigelectrons.com/post/misc/acl-knee-injury-2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>bigelectrons.com/post/misc/acl-knee-injury-2/</guid><description>
Roughly 3 weeks ago on the 5th of October, I had an MTB bike accident and in the process I ended up injuring my left knee. I was actually attempting to Manual during which I realized that I was about to lose my balance. I wanted to bail out from the Manual, so I tried to pull the bike completely to the front with me jump landing behind the rear wheels, but the bailout got totally out of control and eventually I ended up twisting my left knee soon after the jump.</description></item></channel></rss>
