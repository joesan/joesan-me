Recently I had to make a choice of which new car to get so that I can replace my old Diesel car. Given the industry shift to electric vehicles, it is definitely an unfortunate time to buy. In this blog, I wanted to present my simple rational that helped me make my decision.
NOTE: I cannot vouch for the correctness, and I'm not liable if you use this article for basing your purchase decision!</description></item><item><title>Vacation in Paris</title><link>https://bigelectrons.com/post/misc/vacation-in-paris/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bigelectrons.com/post/misc/vacation-in-paris/</guid><description>
I just came back from my vacation in Paris. Just thought of writing down my experience and what I did with my family while in Paris.
How to Reach Paris We decided that we will drive to Paris. From where we are located, it just takes us a 6 to 7-Hour drive by car. On the way, there are plenty of rest places with sufficient facilities for food.
Where to Stay There are tons and tons of options.</description></item></channel></rss>
