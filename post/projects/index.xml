open-electrons is an attempt by myself to abstract all e-mobility related protocols, use cases and much more. In the E-Mobility industry, there are some well known protocols which are industry standard. With the open-electrons project, my aim is to provide a software stack which can be customized and deployed to mimic the functionality of an eMSP (eMobility Service Provider).
For more information, have a look here for some basic documentation and here for the source code.</description></item><item><title>Raspberry Pi Motion &amp; Face Detection</title><link>https://bigelectrons.com/post/projects/project-raspi-motion-detection/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bigelectrons.com/post/projects/project-raspi-motion-detection/</guid><description>
A few weeks after my terrible MTB accident where I tore my ACL on my left knee, I was off from work for a few weeks, and I kind of got bored with just laying in the bed and was pondering what I could be doing something meaningful. Then this idea stuck my mind, why not try doing a small CCTV camera for my home?
I started to do a bit of research on what hardware I need.</description></item><item><title>Plant-Simulator</title><link>https://bigelectrons.com/post/projects/project-plant-simulator/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bigelectrons.com/post/projects/project-plant-simulator/</guid><description>
If you are in the Energy &amp;amp; utilities industry, you might have probably heard about a concept called Virtual Power Plant.
The idea is not new, but it is gaining importance as more and more power producing units (also power consuming units) gets distributed. What does it mean? It just means that the internet offers the possibility to command and control remote power units. The way it works is relatively simple.</description></item></channel></rss>
